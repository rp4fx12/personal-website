Hey there! I am a software engineer in New York City. I grew up near Washington D.C. and worked there for a bit before moving to New York.

I have worked with various tools/frameworks such as AWS, Java, Go, Python, Hadoop, H2O and Node.js amongst others. I am interested in all types of software development but I've worked primarily with backend engineering and big data. I'm also currently learning rust.

When I'm not typing lines of code, I'm usually strumming my ukelele, experimenting in the kitchen or training for my first half marathon.
