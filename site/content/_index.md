Hey there! I am a software engineer at Capital One in New York City. I grew up near Washington D.C. and worked there for a bit before moving to New York.

I have worked with various tools/frameworks such as AWS, Java, Go, Python, Hadoop, H2O and Node.js amongst others. I am interested in all types of software development but I've worked primarily with backend engineering, big data and DevOps.

When I'm not typing lines of code, I'm usually strumming my ukelele, experimenting in the kitchen or training for my first half marathon.
