Hey there! I am a software engineer in New York City. I currently work for LTX, a startup focused on financial trading. I grew up near Washington D.C. and worked there for a bit before moving to New York.

I have worked with various tools and frameworks. Java and Python have been my primary languages for a while but I have worked with NodeJs and GoLang. I also have extensive experience working with AWS, Hadoop and Docker. I am currently in a Masters Program for Data Science/Analytics and on the side I like experimenting with Rust. I primarily have experience working on backend engineering, big data and DevOps but I like learning new things.

When I'm not typing lines of code, I'm usually strumming my ukelele, experimenting in the kitchen or training for my first half marathon.
